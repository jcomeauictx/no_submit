This is a very simple Chrome or Chromium extension to change the text of Submit
buttons to something else. Inspired by Rich Paul.

To install the extension:
   1. `git clone` this repository
   2. Open a new tab and visit <chrome://extensions>
   3. At the top right, slide the Developer Mode button to the right if it isn't already there.
   4. At the left, click [Load unpacked] and navigate to the directory of the cloned repository.
